    <p>Nigerian beans porridge is one of my favourite Nigerian foods to cook, but it has not always been like that. Back when I was a kid, beans was one of the meals I dreaded taking to school for lunch. This was because as kids, we always think beans is a ‘’poor man’s food’’ and kids don’t want to be seen as poor. Whenever my mum cooked beans as my lunch for school, I would either pretend to forget it at home or not bring it out during lunch break, so I won’t be mocked by my classmates. As funny as it sounds, this belief was common among kids, so I’d rather go hungry than eat beans in school. These days, I barely go a week without eating beans and I will proudly take it to work for lunch.</p>

<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Honey beans</li>
    <li>Grounded pepper</li>
    <li>Palm Oil</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>How to prepare</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place saucepan on hob and add 400mls of water and bring to boil.</li>
    <li>While the water is coming to boil, wash 300grams of Nigerian honey beans under cold water and toss into the hot water.</li>
    <li>Add half of the chopped onion and cover the saucepan. More often than not, the water will boil over so you may want to cover the pan with half the lid or leave it uncovered completely so the steam can escape</li>
    <li>Cook for 40mins. Keep checking the beans and add more water when needed. It takes about 2litres of water to cook the 300g of Nigerian beans but be careful not to add too much water at a time. It takes about 40-50mins for the beans to get properly soft and it should look like the this:</li>
    <li>Add the other half of chopped onion, 1 ½ teaspoon of Nigerian grounded pepper or 1 chopped chilli pepper, 75mls of palm oil, 1 Knorr stock cube and 2 teaspoons of salt.</li>
    <li>Add 100mls of water, stir together gently (If you already added too much water, just stir without adding extra water) and simmer for 15min on low heat.</li>
    <li>Serve with bread or fried plantain!</li>
</ol>
